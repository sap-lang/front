## Start with the Basics

- Learn the syntax and fundamental concepts
- Understand variables, data types, and control structures
- Master the language's core operators and expressions

## Practice Consistently

- Write code every day, even if it's just for 30 minutes
- Start with simple programs and gradually increase complexity
- Use coding platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank for practice

## Build Projects

- Create small projects that interest you
- Focus on solving real problems
- Implement what you've learned in practical applications

## Read Documentation

- Study the official language documentation
- Understand best practices and conventions
